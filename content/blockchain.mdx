# Intro

## Blockchain

The concept of a blockchain is actually really simple. Just link together some "blocks" and you have yourself a block-`chain`. You can define a block as a structure that contains some data and some information relevant to the chain as a whole.

### Defining the structure of a block

The block I've implemented contains the minimum requirements to create a block.

```go
type Block struct {
	Hash     []byte // a hash of the Data + PrevHash
	Data     []byte
	PrevHash []byte // linked list functionality (chain)
}
```

- `Hash`: houses a slice of `byte` representative of the blocks's "unique" identity — the hashing algorithm used was `sha256`, not necessarily the most secure
- `Data`: the slice of `byte` that contains the information that's being stored by the block
- `PrevHash`: the slice of `byte` that references the hash of the previous block, ensuring order and forming a linked list

### Defining the blockchain

We can now define a blockchain as a list of blocks.

```go
type BlockChain struct {
	blocks []*Block
}
```

_An array of pointers is used to ensure no copies exist._

## Visualizing the blockchain

Necessary methods like `addBlock()`, `createBlock()`, and `createBlockChain()` help us create and expand the blockchain, while `printBlockChain()` aids in visualizing what's going on.

Let's test the following code:

```go
func main() {
	blockChain := createBlockChain() // the blockchain is created with a genesis block (1st block)

	blockChain.addBlock([]byte("hello blockchain"))
	blockChain.addBlock([]byte("I'm the third block"))
	blockChain.addBlock([]byte("and I'm the fourth block"))

	blockChain.printBlockChain()
}

```

This is the output we got:

```txt
> go run main.go
--------

--------
```

We can see our blockchain taking shape. The data is stored inside blocks that correctly reference the previous block in the blockchain.

Since the blockchain's hash is deterministic — the same input yields the same output — we can run the code multiple times and expect the same output. Normally, blockchains also have multiple copies distributed amongst various nodes.
**This makes blockchains really secure**.
A node's blockchain may be compromised and have a node yield a different hash, i.e., its data tinkered with. Since that chain will be different from the N other exact copies of that chain, the error is quickly caught.

Let's test this further. I'll change the data of the second block to `"Hello blockchain"` with a capital `H`.

```txt

--------
```

If we compare the hashes from this chain and the previous one, we can see that they differ starting from the second block.

# Proof-of-work

In simple terms, proof-of-work ensures that a network's node has provided enough computational power (`work`) to create a block. This newly created block can quickly be validated and `proves` the work computational power was indeed expended.

## Why use proof-of-work?

The way it's set up, to create a new block one must spend enough computational power to find a hash that meets certain criteria. The work that's put into this node is extremely arduous.

## So, what's the actual "work"?

Before we go further, let's add the parameter `nonce` to our block structure.

```go
type Block struct {
	Hash     []byte // a hash of the Data + PrevHash
	Data     []byte
	PrevHash []byte // linked list functionality (chain)
    	Nonce    int
}
```

This value represents a sort of iteration count of the block and is a way to get different hash values from the same contents of the block.

We can also define a structure for a proof-of-work.

```go
type ProofOfWork struct {
	Block  *Block
	Target *big.Int
}
```

- `Block`: the block that's trying to prove its work
- `Target`: an integer threshold which a block's hash must confine to

Let's take a closer look at what a target might look like. First, let's define a difficulty level from 0-256

```go
const Difficulty = 12
```

The value of the `Target` parameter is determined by the inverse of the difficulty.

```go
func NewProof(b *Block) *ProofOfWork {
	target := big.NewInt(1)

	// left shift the bytes 256-Difficulty times
	// 256 is used because it represents the size of the block's hash
	// the number 00000000....000001 would now be 0000...0001000...000000
	//            ^256th bit       ^1st bit                 ^"256-difficulty"th bit
	target.Lsh(target, uint(256-Difficulty))

	return &ProofOfWork{b, target}
}
```

A block now has the goal of creating a hash that, **in this project**, has a lower numerical value than the target. Let's break down what this means.

Say we have a node with data `"Hello World!"` and a starting `nonce` of `0`. Its hash will be computed like so:

```txt
hash(block.PrevHash, block.Data, Nonce, Difficulty) --> hash(..., "Hello World!", 0, 12)
```

Now, let's admit the output was the following:

```txt
2be9e3e49cba8bcdc3c8a1e08d11fa520909249af0f82f409d0e412b83f0adb7
```

Since our `Difficulty` is set to `12`, its hexadecimal value has `2` leading zeros, making it only `62` digits instead of `64`.

```txt
10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

We can now compare our block's hash's output to the target, and check if it's inferior. Since our output has 64 digits and no leading 0s, the block's hash did not meet the target.
This makes the process start over again, but now with a nonce of `1`. This gives a completely different hash that may be less than the target.
This whole mechanism is tucked away inside of the `Run()` method.

Let's see it in action. With `Difficulty` set to `12`, we get the following:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/842cece7-ba54-4648-bb33-583bf88b440a

Now, with `Difficulty` set to `20` — a marginal increase — our program takes a bit more time:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebd7511f-e5b0-4820-a9cd-75494ffd64c1

## And why is proof-of-work so safe?

Imagine we now dial up our `Difficulty` up to `64`.

```txt
1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

Compared to the previous target, the number of acceptable values has gone from `2^(256-12)` to `2^(256-20)`.
Since our hashes have `256 bits`, the probability of finding a hash has decreased from about `0.024%` down to `0.000095%`
The amount of time wasted grows exponentially, and the target´s difficulty increases with the lifespan of the blockchain.

### What if I was to attack the blockchain?

Let's say you wanted to re-write the past and double the amount of a transaction you did a while ago.

1. Starting with that block, you would have to re-hash every single block up until the present. This would take an unprecedented amount of work.
2. Since PoW blockchains determine the valid chain as the longest one (i.e., the one with the most accumulated work), you would have to re-hash every block faster than every other miner combined. Since blockchains are mined by millions of distributed miners, you would need at least `51%` of the network's computational power.
3. Even if you could manage to acquire said power, no financial gain could even be guaranteed.
4. And, worse of all, if an event like this happens, the network can ignore your chain and switch to an honest fork

# Storing the blockchain

A blockchain is nothing without a persistent memory storing it. To this end, we will use the native GO database library `BadgerDB` to handle the read-write storage of our blockchain.
BadgerDB works with `key: value` pairs and stores the bytes in regular files and folders. Since BadgerDB only works with slices of `byte`, we need to refactor some of our structs data handlings.

Using `encoding/gob`, we can now use the `Serialize()` and `Deserialize()` methods to translate data to and from byte structures.

We can also update our blockchain structures by including a parameter referencing the Badger database.

```go
const (
	dbPath = "./tmp/blocks"
)

type BlockChain struct {
	LastHash []byte
	Database *badger.DB
}
```

This means that the blockchain no longer keeps in memory the totality of blocks, but rather reads and writes to the database when necessary.
We also need to keep track of which block the blockchain is at, so we added a parameter `LastHash`.

With this done, we need to rethink our blockchain methods. The `CreateBlockChain()` and `AddBlock()` methods now need to read and write from the DB as needed.

In the meantime, we lost the ability to iterate over our blockchains' blocks.
We can recoup this functionality by creating a helper structure,

```go
type BlockChainIterator struct {
	CurrentHash []byte
	Database    *badger.DB
}
```

and make use of the `Iterator()` and `Next()` methods to iterate over every block.
This completes the persistent storage part, but now we can't really see what's going on.

# CLI

We can implement a simple CLI to remove hardcoded blockchain methods and give the program's users added functionalities.
Using `cli.Run()` on the `main()` method, our program now offers the users the ability to `print` the blockchain or `add` a new block with a given `data`. The full usage is as follows:

```txt
Usage:
    add -block BLOCK_DATA — adds a block to the blockchain
    print — Prints the blocks in the blockchain
```

Let's put it in action!

In this first example, the database has no entry, so a genesis node needs to be created and, most importantly, sign its proof-of-work.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f0d926a-a435-4a82-9936-213b17f265b2

Now, in the following example, let's add two blocks to our blockchain.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0047a3b-5864-47e9-8fdf-340a0504e0f8

# Transactions

Given what we have, let's introduce the concept of transactions to the blockchain.
Since a blockchain is a public database, we never want to store sensitive information like bank accounts or balances.
Transactions allow the transfer of tokens between addresses by consuming previous outputs and creating new ones. This is a major step in understanding how a blockchain manages its existing tokens.

## So... what is a transaction?

At its core, a transaction represents the transfer of value between participants in the blockchain. Instead of tracking balances like a traditional bank ledger, blockchain transactions follow an input-output model. Each transaction spends outputs from previous transactions and creates new outputs that can be used in future transactions.

## Transaction structure

A transaction contains simply encapsulates inputs and outputs:

```go
type Transaction struct {
	ID      []byte              // unique transaction identifier (hash)
	Inputs  []TransactionInput  // references to previous transaction outputs
	Outputs []TransactionOutput // new outputs containing tokens and recipient addresses
}
```

- `Inputs`: a slice that points to outputs from previous transactions (UTXOs)

  ```go
  type TransactionInput struct {
      ID        []byte // the ID of the transaction whose outputs will serve as inputs
      Output    int    // the index of the list of outputs of that transaction
      Signature string // ownership proof
  }
  ```

- `Outputs`: a slice containing new UTXOs, specifying the amount and the recipient's public key

  ```go
  type TransactionOutput struct {
      Value     int    // token amount
      PublicKey string // the recepient's address
  }
  ```

## Kickstart transactions

Like blocks, transactions need previous transactions to point to.
Similarly to the genesis blocks, a coinbase transaction referes to the first transaction of the blockchain.
This special transaction is also used to reward the first miner with tokens, and we can create it using the `CoinbaseTx()` method.

Once that's done, regular transactions can ensue with the help of the `newTransaction()` method. A new transaction block only occurs when the sender has enough tokens for that transaction.

## Practical scenario

Alice has 10 tokens and wants to send 7 to Bob. In a blockchain system, this transaction is structured into inputs and outputs.

### Step 1: Identifying the Input

Alice owns a **previous unspent transaction output (UTXO)** worth **10 tokens**. She will use this as the input for her new transaction.

| **Transaction ID** | **Output Index** | **Value** | **Owner** |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | --------- | --------- |
| xyz789             | 0                | 10        | Alice     |

- **Transaction ID (`xyz789`)**: Identifies the transaction where Alice received the tokens.
- **Output Index (`0`)**: Specifies which output within that transaction she is spending.
- **Value (`10`)**: The amount available to spend.
- **Owner (`Alice`)**: The person who can spend this output.

### Step 2: Creating Outputs

Alice sends **7 tokens** to Bob, but since she started with **10 tokens**, she needs to get **3 tokens** back as change.

| **Value** | **Recipient**  |
| --------- | -------------- |
| 7         | Bob            |
| 3         | Alice (Change) |

- **Bob receives 7 tokens** in a new output.
- **Alice gets 3 tokens back** in another output (her change).

### Step 3: Structuring the Transaction

| **Transaction ID** | **Inputs**              | **Outputs**        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| abc123             | ID: xyz789, OutIndex: 0 | 7 → Bob, 3 → Alice |

- **Transaction ID (`abc123`)**: A unique identifier for the new transaction.
- **Inputs**: References Alice’s previous transaction (`xyz789`).
- **Outputs**:
  - 7 tokens to Bob.
  - 3 tokens returned to Alice.

## Showcase

Let's see what we have got in action.

# Wallets

Right now, the blockchain is using conventional strings to define an address.
Now is the perfect opportunity to introduce wallets into the blockchain.
Wallets hold your cryptographic keys, serving as the cornerstone for secure identity and transaction management in the blockchain.

## What Are Wallets?

Wallets encapsulate a user's identity by managing a pair of cryptographic keys — a private key that must be kept secret, and a public key used to derive the blockchain address.
Our wallets use the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with the P256 curve. The private key is generated securely, and the public key is constructed by concatenating the X and Y coordinates from the ECDSA key pair.

## Creating addresses

A blockchain address is derived by hashing a random public key with SHA256, then with RIPEMD160, appending a version byte, and adding a checksum before finally encoding the result in Base58.
Base 58 is similar to base 64, only that its missing the characters `0 O l I + /`. This was done because addresses are the main way that people send tokens to, and having addresses with those characters can make the addresses wrongly interpreted and misstyped

As of writing, I'm yet to integrate the wallets' functionalities to the blockchain. So, for now, they do the exact same thing as conventional strings. :)

# Digital Signatures

Digital signatures are a crucial component of a blockchain. They ensure the authenticity and integrity of our transactions.

## What go in to these Digital Signatures?

A digital signature is a mechanism that allows someone to verify that a transaction was indeed created by the owner of the private key associated with the sender's address.  
Here's a simple example of how transaction signing works:

| Step                 | Description                                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transaction Creation | **Alice** wants to send 5 tokens to **Bob**. She creates a transaction and signs it with her _private key_.   |
| Signature Generation | The signature is generated using Alice's _private key_ and the transaction data.                              |
| Broadcasting         | Alice broadcasts the signed transaction to the network.                                                       |
| Verification         | Nodes use Alice's _public key_ to verify the signature. If valid, the transaction is added to the blockchain. |

Alice uses her private key to create a signature that can only be verified using her public key, proving she authorized the transaction.

### Can't someone just fake their identity?

No - this is where the cryptographic magic of public/private key pairs comes in. Even if someone has Alice's public key and can see her transactions, they cannot create valid signatures without her private key. If someone gets access to your private key, they can create valid signatures and essentially steal your identity on the blockchain. This is also why our wallet implementation carefully manages private keys and never exposes them.

Looking at our code, you can see this security in action:

- The `Wallet` struct keeps the private key secure internally
- `newKeyPair()` generates the cryptographic key pair using secure random numbers
- `sign()` uses the private key to create signatures that can be verified with `Verify()`
- The actual signing uses **ECDSA** (_Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm_) which provides strong cryptographic guarantees

### How can someone be sure that a transaction is acutally mine?

The verification process ties all of this together. When someone receives your transaction, they can mathematically verify it came from you by checking that the signature matches your public key. Our `Verify()` method implements this check using ECDSA, making it impossible for anyone without your private key to create valid transactions. This creates a secure, trustless system where authenticity can be verified by anyone.

# Creating a UTXOs persistence layer

As our blockchain grows, the need for efficient transaction validation becomes paramount. Previously, our blockchain iterated over all transactions to find unspent outputs, which was computationally expensive and time-consuming. By introducing a UTXO persistence layer, we can significantly optimize the speed of lookups and transaction validations.

## How It Works

The UTXO persistence layer stores UTXOs in a dedicated database, allowing for quick access and updates. This approach reduces the need to traverse the entire blockchain for each transaction, thus enhancing performance.

- Storage: UTXOs are stored in a key-value database, where the key is the transaction ID and the value is a list of unspent outputs.
- Updates: When a transaction is processed, the UTXO set is updated to reflect the consumed and newly created outputs.

## Fun Fact

Whilst studying this, I learned that the Bitcoin blockchain, which also uses a UTXO model, occupies only around **200GB**!? This is a banger of a testament to the efficiency of the UTXO model in managing large volumes of transactions.

# Merkle Tree

One of the key challenges in blockchain systems is efficiently verifying transactions without processing the entire block's data. This is where Merkle Trees come in - a brilliant data structure that allows us to validate transactions with minimal computational overhead.

## What is a Merkle Tree?

Simply put, a Merkle Tree consists of these 3 factos:

- each leaf node contains the hash of a transaction
- each non-leaf node contains the hash of its **two** children combined
- the root node represents a single hash that essentially "summarizes" all transactions

### Simple Example

Let's say we have 4 transactions (Tx1-Tx4). Here's how they form a Merkle Tree:

```txt
Level 2 (Root):     Hash(AB + CD)
                         /    \
Level 1:       Hash(A+B)      Hash(C+D)
                /    \        /    \
Level 0:    Hash(Tx1) Hash(Tx2) Hash(Tx3) Hash(Tx4)
```

## Why Use Merkle Trees?

The beauty of Merkle Trees lies in their efficiency. Instead of verifying **every transaction** individually, we can:

1. Store just the Merkle Root (32 bytes) to represent all transactions
2. Validate any transaction by providing a "proof path" (~log2(n) hashes)
3. Detect any changes to transactions, as they would alter the root hash

### Practical Benefits

| Without Merkle Tree           | With Merkle Tree                  |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Must download entire block    | Can verify with partial data      |
| Linear verification time O(n) | Logarithmic verification O(log n) |
| High bandwidth usage          | Minimal data transfer             |

## Implementation Details

Our implementation includes some clever optimizations:

- Automatic balancing by duplicating the last transaction if odd-numbered
- Concurrent processing of transaction hashes
- Integration with the existing UTXO model

The most significant change is in how we calculate transaction hashes. Instead of a simple SHA256 of concatenated transactions, we now use:

```go
tree := newMerkleTree(txHashes)
return tree.RootNode.Data
```

This small change brings massive scalability benefits as the blockchain grows.

## Another Fun Fact

Bitcoin's Merkle Tree implementation allows you to verify a transaction with just 1KB of data from a block, even though the full block might be 1MB or larger. This is why "light clients" can operate efficiently without downloading the entire blockchain!
