# homeserver stuff

running a homeserver is really cool, and actually very simple. I've come to bother everyone I talk to and trying to convice them to repurpouse their old computers. it always starts the same, _"hey! did you know you can have X and Y running locally!?"_

this post is actually a tutorial in disguise :)

## the old pc

the old/unused beast I'm having straped 24/7 running useless services is the **HP ProDesk 400 G3 SFF**. I flashed that business workhorse with ubuntu server and a couple of external hard drives and it now packs a punch

wait, can I even put neofetch in here??

## CasaOS

getting started was a brease with [CasaOS](https://casaos.io/). just run `curl -fsSL https://get.casaos.io | sudo bash` and you have yourself a well-designed and simple-to-use UI avilable on the browser

that's legit **80%** of the way done.

## services

installing services through the CasaOS web app is stupidly easy, though a bit limited. you can also follow my steps and shoot yourself in the foot trying to learn and user docker containers

here's a simplified list of what I have going on inside the homeserver â€”Â I highly recommend actually learning what they do, and not take my word for it
    - [Immich](https://github.com/immich-app/immich) (_**CasaOS app store**_): simply put, a free unlimited-storage google photos alternative (unlimited if you have the $ for those drives)
    - [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) (_**CasaOS app store**_): a sleek platform to manage docker containers
    - [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/): their slogan says it all â€” _"Network-wide Ad Blocking"_
    - [your_spotify](https://github.com/Yooooomi/your_spotify): why wait for spotify wrapped to come when you can use their API and get charts with even better insights?
    - Discord bot: a python program that pings and periodically alerts our discord servers of upcoming tests'/project's due dates
    - Kali Linux VM: self-explanatory


the thing about having a homeserver is that you start to realise you can self host pretty much everything with the added benefit of not relying on any third-party services with hundreds of engineers working around the clock on million dollar servers. **only you and your humble computer** ðŸ¤”

## accessing the server

well you'll need to eventually access the server. CasaOS does a great job in terms of webUI, but ssh-_ing_ into the server is way cooler. instead of exposing router ports or using a proxy server, I opted to use [tailscale](https://tailscale.com). it's a private VPN for your devices to communicate with eachother

pair that up with a DNS and I get access to my homeserver and its services via [homserver.eduardofaria.pt](homserver.eduardofaria.pt) (when on LAN) or [server.eduardofaria.pt](server.eduardofaria.pt) (when on WAN). you can try to access it, but the beauty is that only with tailscale permissions can you actually use them :)

## other cool stuff

- _suuuper_ quiet fans
- 2TB external hard drive
- 1GBs ethernet speeds for fast file transfer speeds 
- stay-at-home mom for relliable reboots from power outages
