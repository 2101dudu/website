# WakaTime

on a random morning I saw a story on instagram from a 10x developer that was doing a 24/7 solo hackathon. to prove it, he was using this platform called [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com)

curiosity got the best of me and, sure enough, I later integrated its API into my IDEs

## the dashboard

WakaTime essentially tracks time spent conding across a ton of metrics. think projects, languages, IDEs, OSs. this is part is cool, it shows neat graphs and stuff

what's actually scary is working on something during the day only to later realize you spent 6+ hours coding 

### my metrics

I've just learned that the platform offers cool ways to show off my stats, check it out:

_the bottom line here is that tracking data is cool, understanding what that data means is not_
